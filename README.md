## Synopsis

**syncSMS** is a SMS/text messaging communications door originally designed for running under [Synchronet BBS Software](http://www.synchro.net).  It allows users to 
send text messages to the SysOp as a method of communicating with him/her without having to disclose the SysOp's cell number. It requires an API key from [Twilio](https://twilio.com). It was originally written by Robert Stinnett aka dmxrob of [Gateway to the West BBS - bbs.dmxrob.net](telnet://bbs.dmxrob.net) as a way to get back into BBSing and learn more about Synchronet and Javascript.

The SysOp receives the message showing the username who sent it, the phone number the user provided and the message.
