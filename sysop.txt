I) What is syncSMS?

syncSMS is a Synchronet BBS door that allows you to give users the ability to send SMS text messages to you.  It is not designed to allow users to get in touch with 
you when an urgent situation arises without having to give out your personal cell phone number or contact information. I designed this door just as another way to learn
Javascript, but felt it could potentially be useful to SysOps as an alternative method of letting users get in touch with them for urgent situations.

syncSMS requires a valid Twilio account to run (see below).  As such, this door will cost to run.  Currently, as of February 2019, the cost to send a SMS message via
Twilio is $ 0.0075 per message (less than a penny).  There is a $1.00 per month charge for an outgoing number.

****> The average monthly cost to run this door is estimated to be between $1.00 and $ 1.75 <****

II) Getting a TWilio API Key

To use this door, you must have a Twilio account.  Twilio provides the service by which SMS messages can be sent.  It has a number of telephony features beyond SMS messaging,
and I've used it for a number of projects over the years.  Twilio is a PAID service, though you can try Twilio for 30 days for free.

To get your key simply sign up at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio.  You will then want to follow the instructions to get your Twilio Sid number and Twilio Auth Token.

If you run into any issues, drop me a line at robert@robertstinnett.com.

III) Setting up the syncSMS App (currency.js):

1: If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the
   folder "syncSMS" (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/syncSMS/). 

2: Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):


[syncSMS]
smsToNumber = <Your cell phone numebr to receive SMS message on, must start with a +1>
smsFromNumber = <The number you picked in Twilio.  This is not your cell phone number>
twilioAccountSid = <Your Twilio Sid token>
twilioAuthToken = <Your Twilio Auth Token>


All phone numbers must be in this format +15554443333 where 555 is your area code and 4443333 is your phone number.  

NOTE: No quotes are needed in the modopts.ini section you added. 
   
5: Set up the External Door via Synchornet Configuration, External Programs

* You may wish to only assign this door to trusted users with elevated security priviledges since it will send you SMS/text msgs. *
